 * # Whisper Security Threat Intelligence API  The Whisper Security API provides comprehensive threat intelligence, geolocation data, and security operations capabilities for enterprise security teams and developers.  ## Key Capabilities  - **Indicator Enrichment**: Get comprehensive intelligence on IP addresses and domains including   geolocation, WHOIS, DNS, reputation scoring, and relationship mapping. - **Geolocation Services**: Fast IP-to-location lookups with ISP, ASN, and network information. - **Security Operations**: Asynchronous tools for bulk enrichment, infrastructure scanning,   AI-powered threat investigation, and monitoring.  ## API Design  - **RESTful**: Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with JSON request/response bodies. - **Synchronous Endpoints**: Fast responses (<500ms) for indicator enrichment and geolocation. - **Asynchronous Jobs**: Long-running operations return a job ID for polling results. - **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error responses with status codes, error codes, and messages.  ## Authentication  All API endpoints require Bearer token authentication. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header: `Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>`  ## Rate Limits  Rate limits are applied per-user and vary by endpoint category:  | Endpoint Category | Rate Limit | Description | |-------------------|------------|-------------| | Indicators (`/v1/indicators/_*`) | 100 req/sec | Single indicator enrichment | | Location (`/v1/location/_*`) | 100 req/sec | Geolocation lookups | | Jobs (`/v1/ops/jobs/_*`) | 100 req/sec | Job status and listing | | Bulk Operations (`/v1/ops/enrichment/bulk`) | 10 req/sec | Bulk indicator processing | | Screenshots (`/v1/ops/screenshots/_*`) | 10 req/sec | Screenshot capture and scheduling | | Scans (`/v1/ops/scans/_*`) | 10 req/sec | Infrastructure scanning | | Monitoring (`/v1/ops/monitoring/_*`) | 10 req/sec | Uptime monitoring | | Tracking (`/v1/ops/tracking/_*`) | 10 req/sec | Change tracking | | AI Investigate (`/v1/ops/ai/investigate`) | 5 req/min | Deep threat investigation | | AI Correlate (`/v1/ops/ai/correlate`) | 5 req/min | Global correlation | | AI Attribute (`/v1/ops/ai/attribute`) | 5 req/min | Threat actor attribution | | AI Pivot (`/v1/ops/ai/pivot`) | 5 req/min | Infrastructure pivoting |  When rate limits are exceeded, the API returns HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header indicating when you can retry. The response body includes: ```json {   \"error\": \"Too Many Requests\",   \"message\": \"Rate limit exceeded for <category>. Please retry after N seconds.\",   \"retryAfter\": N } ```  ## Response Conventions  - All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format (UTC). - Pagination uses `limit` and `offset` parameters. - Field names use camelCase throughout the API.  ## Official SDKs  - **Python**: [github.com/whisper-sec/sdk-python](https://github.com/whisper-sec/sdk-python) - **TypeScript/JavaScript**: [github.com/whisper-sec/sdk-typescript](https://github.com/whisper-sec/sdk-typescript) - **Java**: [github.com/whisper-sec/sdk-java](https://github.com/whisper-sec/sdk-java) - **C#/.NET**: [github.com/whisper-sec/sdk-csharp](https://github.com/whisper-sec/sdk-csharp)  ## Resources  - **Website**: [whisper.security](https://whisper.security) - **Dashboard**: [dash.whisper.security](https://dash.whisper.security) - Manage API keys and view usage - **Documentation**: [docs.whisper.security](https://docs.whisper.security) - Guides and tutorials
